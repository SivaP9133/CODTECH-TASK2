## MATH QUIZ- AN INTERACTIVE QUIZ APPLICATION  

This HTML code is the basic structure for a "Math Quiz" web page. It sets up the layout and includes placeholders for styling and functionality that will be provided by external CSS and JavaScript files. Hereâ€™s a breakdown:

### 1. **HTML Document Declaration and Structure**
   - **`<!DOCTYPE html>`**: Declares that the document is an HTML5 document.
   - **`<html lang="en">`**: Defines the language as English.

### 2. **`<head>` Section**
   - **`<meta charset="UTF-8">`**: Sets the character encoding to UTF-8 for a wide range of characters.
   - **`<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">`**: Ensures that the page is responsive, scaling properly on various screen sizes.
   - **`<title>Math Quiz</title>`**: Sets the title displayed on the browser tab.
   - **`<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">`**: Links to an external CSS file named `styles.css`, which will style the page.

### 3. **`<body>` Section**
   - **`<div class="container">`**: A container div that wraps all content, making it easier to style and control layout.
   - **`<h1>Math Quiz</h1>`**: A main heading displaying "Math Quiz."
   - **`<div id="quiz"></div>`**: A placeholder for the quiz content where questions and answer choices will likely be inserted dynamically via JavaScript.
   - **`<div id="result" class="result"></div>`**: A placeholder for showing the result or score after the user submits answers.
   - **Buttons**:
      - **`<button id="submit" class="button">Submit</button>`**: A submit button to submit quiz answers.
      - **`<button id="retry" class="button hide">Retry</button>`**: A retry button, initially hidden, allowing the user to retake the quiz.
      - **`<button id="showAnswer" class="button hide">Show Answer</button>`**: A button, initially hidden, to reveal the correct answers.

### 4. **JavaScript File Inclusion**
   - **`<script src="script.js"></script>`**: Links to an external JavaScript file named `script.js`. This file will likely contain the logic for generating questions, calculating scores, handling button interactions, and displaying results.

### Purpose of the Code
This code sets up a simple and interactive Math Quiz webpage. It creates a structured layout with placeholders for quiz content, results, and controls (Submit, Retry, Show Answer buttons). Styling and functionality are externalized in `styles.css` and `script.js`, making the code organized and modular for easier development and maintenance.
